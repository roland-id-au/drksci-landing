**RE: Intelligence Role**

To whom it may concern,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the advertised intelligence role. My professional experience has been defined by a relentless drive to understand, analyse, and subvert complex digital systems, a skill set I believe is intimately applicable to this role.

A career built on a deep, hands-on understanding of how systems function and, more importantly, how they can be exploited. My work has included:

# Background

## System Exploitation & Subversion

My hands-on experience includes disrupting the BitTorrent ecosystem by developing elaborate WMV format DRM header rewrite highjacks and using OSS BitTorrent tracker exploits. I also employed DHT poisoning to influence popular files, and automated the entire process of content submission. During the Internet Explorer era, I developed a silent BHO that rewrote all advertiser banners to deploy permanent affiliate marketing cookies. This project was ultimately abandoned due to legal risk after reaching approximately 250,000 installs.

## Geospatial Intelligence & Reconnaissance

I have a strong interest in digital reconnaissance methods and geospatial intelligence, with a long-standing personal use application to scalable characterisation of abandoned mines for spelunking.

## Relentless Investigation

My approach to problem-solving is relentless, one example of which is the successful decade-long search for a lost underground science lab, lost for 59 years. [https://photos.app.goo.gl/mnj5ZMd6QYviYoNX8](https://photos.app.goo.gl/mnj5ZMd6QYviYoNX8).

## Ground Truth Perspective

I have extensive ground truth perspective on digital reconnaissance analysis versus actuals, painstakingly validated as below. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jVrsfhZahM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jVrsfhZahM).

## SecOps

I have executive, operational, and subject matter expert experience directing and analyzing Vulnerability & Penetration Testing and GRC programs.

# Current Research & Outlook

## Predictive AI Behavior Modeling

I am researching human, animal, and logistics behavioral modeling, including traversal strategy and terrain defensibility/insurgence prediction. My recent work includes AI / SAR human movement behavioral prediction and analysis, such as the Mapgyver lost person modeling documented here: [https://drksci.com/research/mapgyver-lost-person-modeling](https://drksci.com/research/mapgyver-lost-person-modeling).

## Digital Audio & Covert Sensing

I am exploring how to use optics and binary interference patterns (rather than DSP) for scalable audio surveillance. This interest extends to covert sensing through miniaturised discrete audiosondes with LoRa or drone/BT uplink.

## Corporate OSINT

I am developing automated methods for insider trading intelligence through the relationship analysis of hidden 'arms-length' parties, such as evaluating situations where a site contractor coincidentally invests in a mining concern after performing work â€” ostensibly for proprietary automated trading purposes.

In my view, "side channel" intelligence acquisition and automated analysis will be of increasing significance for situational awareness. My unique background and hands-on expertise are perfectly suited to tackle these complex challenges.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
