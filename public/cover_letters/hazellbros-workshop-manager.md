**RE: Workshop Manager Role**
<br>
<br>
<br>
To the Hazell Bros Team,
<br>
<br>
To be upfront, I realise I'm probably not the applicant you're expecting. I've spent most of my career leading software operations—not running workshops. But my background in operational leadership, safety culture, and building high-performing teams could bring something meaningful to your operation.

My wife Hannah and I have been visiting Tasmania regularly for years. We've stayed at the Bischoff Hotel in Waratah multiple times, and we're ready to relocate. This isn't just about the job—Tasmania is where we want to be.

# What I Bring

## Operational Leadership with a Safety-First Mindset

As CEO of ValuePRO Software, I ran operations for a complex organisation with 40+ customised product forks requiring meticulous coordination across distributed teams. I maintained ISO27001 and ISO9001 certifications with zero audit findings across 5+ years—establishing frameworks where safety and quality are non-negotiable.

My style is pragmatic and hands-on. I've led operations where downtime meant direct financial impact to clients, and I've built systems and teams that consistently delivered under pressure while maintaining 40-50% EBITA margins and team engagement scores (eNPS) of 8.5-9.5/10.

## Building Teams & Multi-Site Coordination

I've built high-performing teams through structured training pathways, clear expectations, and genuine investment in people's growth. My no-bullshit approach means setting clear standards, backing my team when needed, and holding people accountable when required.

I've coordinated operations across distributed locations and offshore teams, ensuring consistent quality standards despite geographic separation. I've developed KPI frameworks that balanced performance targets with team capacity and well-being.

# Why This Makes Sense

I understand workshop operations differ from software operations. Equipment maintenance programmes, fleet management, and trade supervision aren't my current expertise—but operational discipline, safety culture, team development, and performance management are transferable skills.

Hazell Bros' commitment to "Safety 1st Always Works", employee development, and community engagement resonates with how I've always led. I also noticed your recent government tendering activity (Bureau of Meteorology's AMBLS construction at Clifton Beach, DCCEEW's Mawson Workshop project)—government procurement is something I'd be keen to explore streamlining to maximise opportunities for Hazell Bros.

I'm ready to relocate to Tasmania, learn your operation inside and out, and contribute to Hazell Bros' continued success.

It's hard to really understand someone from a paper resume, so here are a few examples of what I get up to—and hopefully some light entertainment: I've spent time working on search and rescue research, including analysing the Celine Cremer case in Tasmania ([SAR photos here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/mnj5ZMd6QYviYoNX8)). Like I said—[Tasmania is where we want to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jVrsfhZahM).

Available for discussion at your convenience.
