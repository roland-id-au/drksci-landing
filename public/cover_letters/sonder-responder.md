To the Sonder Team,
<br>
<br>
I am writing to express my strong interest in the Sonder Responder position in Queensland. My unique combination of technical leadership, emergency response mindset, and genuine commitment to supporting others makes me an ideal fit for this role.

<br>

# Relevant Experience

My professional background has been defined by responding to critical situations under pressure. As CEO of ValuePRO Software, I regularly managed high-stakes incidents affecting mission-critical systems serving the valuation industry. This required rapid assessment, clear decision-making, and calm communication during emergencies â€” skills directly transferable to the Sonder Responder role.

## Field Work & Search and Rescue Research

My passion for remote places and underground exploration has given me extensive hands-on experience in risk assessment, behavioral modeling, and working in unpredictable environments:

**MapGyver SAR Research (2024)**: Developed AI-powered lost person behavioral prediction system, demonstrated through analysis of real missing person case (Celine Cremer, Queensland). This research project involved:
- Building predictive models for human movement in wilderness environments
- Analyzing terrain features and environmental factors affecting search probability
- Developing systematic approaches to high-probability search area identification
- Applying behavioral prediction modeling to optimize search strategies

**Decade-Long Underground Investigation**: Successfully completed a 10-year search for a lost underground science lab, missing for 59 years ([Upper Cooney Tunnel Rediscovery](https://photos.app.goo.gl/mnj5ZMd6QYviYoNX8)):
- Relentless investigation combining historical research and field reconnaissance
- Ground truth validation of digital reconnaissance versus actual field conditions
- Conducting thorough risk assessments before entering unknown underground environments
- Maintaining composure and making sound decisions in isolated, high-risk situations

This research and field experience directly translates to the Sonder Responder role's requirement for calm decision-making, situational assessment, and supporting people in challenging circumstances.

## Technical & Operational Background

My background includes:

- **Security Operations**: Executive leadership in vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and security incident response
- **ISO Compliance**: Maintained ISO27001 & ISO9001 certification with zero audit findings
- **Operational Procedures**: Developed and refined operational procedures across complex organisations
- **24/7 Operations**: Managed round-the-clock operations and on-call responsibilities throughout my career
