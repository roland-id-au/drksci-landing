**RE: Sonder Responder - Queensland (Job ID: 5935145002)**

To the Sonder Team,
<br>
<br>
I am writing to express my strong interest in the Sonder Responder position in Queensland. My background combining emergency response experience, behavioral modeling research, and relentless problem-solving makes me uniquely suited to this role.

# Background

## Emergency Response & Crisis Management

My professional background has been defined by responding to critical situations under pressure. As CEO of ValuePRO Software, I regularly managed high-stakes incidents affecting mission-critical systems serving the valuation industry. This required rapid assessment, clear decision-making, and calm communication during emergencies — precisely the skillset Sonder Responders employ daily.

## Geospatial Intelligence & Ground Truth Perspective

I have extensive ground truth perspective on digital reconnaissance analysis versus actuals, repeatedly and painstakingly validated through spelunking and underground exploration. This includes successful completion of a decade-long search for a lost underground science lab, lost for 59 years —

This work demonstrates my relentless approach to investigation and required:
- Conducting thorough risk assessments before entering unknown environments
- Maintaining composure and making sound decisions in isolated, high-risk situations
- Ground truth validation of digital reconnaissance versus actual field conditions ([Carbonate Hill, NM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jVrsfhZahM))

My recent work includes AI / SAR human movement behavioral prediction and analysis, such as the MapGyver lost person modeling —

This research directly complements Sonder's mission to anticipate and respond to member needs effectively.

## Strategic Network Building

Throughout my career, I've built and maintained extensive professional networks across Queensland and Australia. As a founder and executive, I've developed strong relationships with stakeholders across government, private sector, and community organisations. This network, combined with my natural ability to build rapport quickly, would be invaluable in fulfilling Sonder's partnership and stakeholder engagement responsibilities.

## SecOps & Operational Excellence

I have executive, operational, and subject matter expert experience directing and analyzing security programs, including:

- Maintained ISO27001 & ISO9001 certification with zero audit findings
- Managed 24/7 operations and on-call responsibilities throughout my career
- Developed and refined operational procedures across complex organisations

# Why Sonder

Sonder's mission resonates deeply with me. The opportunity to provide direct, meaningful support to people in their moments of need aligns perfectly with my values and desire for impactful work. I'm particularly drawn to:

- The flexible 24-hour on-call model that accommodates my technical consulting work
- Building and nurturing a response network across Queensland
- Contributing operational insights to improve support procedures
- Working with a technology-driven care platform

I bring high self-awareness, strong interpersonal sensitivity, and the ability to prioritise effectively under pressure. My unique background combining emergency response experience, behavioral modeling research, and genuine empathy positions me uniquely to excel in this role.

I am ready to complete all required checks (National Police Check, WWCC) and am excited about the opportunity to make a meaningful difference as a Sonder Responder.

Available for discussion at your convenience.

Sincerely,
