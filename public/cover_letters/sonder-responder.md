To the Sonder Team,
<br>
<br>
I am writing to express my strong interest in the Sonder Responder position in Queensland. My unique combination of technical leadership, emergency response mindset, and genuine commitment to supporting others makes me an ideal fit for this role.

# Relevant Experience

My professional background has been defined by responding to critical situations under pressure. As CEO of ValuePRO Software, I regularly managed high-stakes incidents affecting mission-critical systems serving the valuation industry. This required rapid assessment, clear decision-making, and calm communication during emergencies â€” skills directly transferable to the Sonder Responder role.

## Field Work & Search and Rescue Experience

My passion for remote places and underground exploration has given me extensive hands-on experience in search and rescue, risk assessment, and working in unpredictable environments:

**Search for Celiune (2024)**: Participated in coordinated search efforts for missing person Celiune Yates in remote Queensland bushland. This involved:
- Coordinating with Queensland Police and volunteer search teams
- Conducting systematic grid searches in challenging terrain
- Applying behavioral prediction modeling to identify high-probability search areas
- Maintaining discipline and focus during extended search operations in harsh conditions

**Decade-Long SAR Investigation**: Successfully completed a 10-year search for a lost underground science lab, missing for 59 years ([Upper Cooney Tunnel Rediscovery](https://photos.app.goo.gl/mnj5ZMd6QYviYoNX8)):
- Relentless investigation combining historical research and field reconnaissance
- Ground truth validation of digital reconnaissance versus actual field conditions
- Conducting thorough risk assessments before entering unknown underground environments
- Maintaining composure and making sound decisions in isolated, high-risk situations

This experience directly translates to the Sonder Responder role's requirement for calm decision-making, field assessment, and supporting people in challenging circumstances.

## Technical & Operational Background

My background includes:

- **Security Operations**: Executive leadership in vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and security incident response
- **ISO Compliance**: Maintained ISO27001 & ISO9001 certification with zero audit findings
- **Operational Procedures**: Developed and refined operational procedures across complex organisations
- **24/7 Operations**: Managed round-the-clock operations and on-call responsibilities throughout my career
