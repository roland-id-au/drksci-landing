# Managing Cofounder: GetSmart

## I. Executive Summary: The Opportunity

**GetSmart** (getsmart.site) represents a rare inflection point: a technically sophisticated, architecturally sound AI platform at the pre-MVP stage, seeking a Managing Cofounder to transform a proven concept into a market-leading product.

The founding technical vision is exceptional—a multi-agent AI research system that doesn't just aggregate information, but **draws inferences and generates insights** beyond stated facts. The architecture is elegant: 17+ specialized agents collaborating through a shared knowledge graph, orchestrated by a meta-prompt generator that dynamically determines how to analyze each subject. This isn't another AI wrapper. This is a fundamentally new approach to stakeholder intelligence.

The market timing is perfect. Investment firms, corporate development teams, and executive recruiters currently spend 20+ hours on manual due diligence research that GetSmart can compress into 5 minutes with superior depth and quality. The target addressable market spans multiple high-value B2B segments, all of which pay premium prices for quality intelligence.

What's missing is **operational leadership and execution**. The technical foundation has been laid. The product architecture is elegant and extensible. The business model is validated. What's needed now is a Managing Cofounder who can:

1. **Execute the MVP to market** (Months 1-6)
2. **Build and lead the engineering team** (Months 3-12)
3. **Drive go-to-market strategy** (Beta → 1,000 paying customers)
4. **Raise capital** (Target: $2-3M seed round in Q2 2025)
5. **Partner on strategic vision** (Product roadmap, partnerships, growth)

This is not a hired-gun CTO role. This is a **true cofounder equity stake** in a venture with the technical foundations to become the intelligence platform of record for professional stakeholders.

## II. The Product: GetSmart Architecture & Vision

### A. What Makes GetSmart Different

Traditional research tools apply generic templates. GetSmart **learns about the subject first**, then determines how to analyze them. It's the difference between a paint-by-numbers portrait and a commissioned work by a master.

**Core Differentiators:**

1. **Inference Engine** ⭐ — The system doesn't just report facts; it identifies patterns, draws conclusions, and generates hypotheses with confidence scores. This is the key technical moat.

2. **Meta-Prompt Generator** — The "brain" that dynamically generates subject-specific analysis prompts. For an agricultural tech founder, it knows to focus on producer sovereignty and regional ecosystems. For a VC, it emphasizes pattern recognition in investment theses.

3. **Multi-Agent Architecture** — 17+ specialized agents (Research, Analysis, Inference, Synthesis) collaborate through a shared knowledge graph. Each agent contributes discrete insights that compound into comprehensive intelligence.

4. **Dynamic Faceted Analysis** — The system automatically identifies relevant analytical dimensions based on who the person is. For a founder, it might analyze their approach to risk and iteration. For an investor, their pattern recognition and thesis evolution. The report adapts to surface what actually matters for this specific person.

5. **Configuration-Driven Extensibility** — Add new data sources, analytical dimensions, or agent types without touching core code. The system is built for continuous capability expansion.

### B. Technical Foundation (Already Built)

## III. Vision & Roadmap

### A. Beyond the MVP: The Full Vision

GetSmart isn't just a research tool—it's a platform for **augmented intelligence about people**. The current architecture (multi-agent, knowledge graph, inference engine) is the foundation. Here's where it can go:

**Browser Extension**
- Real-time intelligence as you browse LinkedIn, Twitter, Crunchbase
- Hover over someone's name → instant mini-report
- "Research this person" button on any profile
- Save insights to your knowledge base

**Expanded Analysis Facets**
- **Negotiation Patterns** — How they negotiate, what they value in exchanges
- **Innovation Approach** — How they identify and validate opportunities
- **Leadership & Team Dynamics** — How they lead, delegate, and build culture
- **Mental Models & Reasoning** — How they think through complex problems
- **Communication & Persuasion** — Their style, effectiveness, and audience adaptation
- **Strategic Positioning** — How they approach competition and market dynamics
- **Decision-Making Under Uncertainty** — How they handle risk and incomplete information
- **Network Building & Influence** — How they cultivate and leverage relationships
- **User-Defined Facets** — Let power users add their own analytical dimensions tailored to their use case (e.g., "Board governance style" for investors, "Technical depth" for recruiters)

**CRM & Workflow Integration**
- Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive native integrations
- Auto-research when new contact added
- Keep intelligence synced and up-to-date
- Trigger research on deal stage changes

**Social Graph Mapping**
- Not just "who they know" but "who influences them"
- Identify mutual connections and best introduction paths
- Map ideological alignment and affinity groups
- Track relationship strength signals over time

**Continuous Intelligence**
- Subscribe to someone's intelligence feed
- Get alerts when they publish, speak, or make news
- Track changes in their network or position
- Monitor sentiment shifts in their communication

**Team Intelligence**
- Research entire leadership teams at once
- Identify team dynamics, power structures, decision-makers
- Map complementary vs. conflicting philosophies
- Predict team behavior based on individual patterns

**Comparative Analysis**
- Side-by-side intelligence on multiple subjects
- "Find me founders similar to [X]"
- Pattern matching across your entire research history

**Synthetic Personas (The Next Frontier)**
- Create AI-powered digital twins based on researched individuals
- Interact with a synthetic persona that mimics their decision-making patterns, communication style, and reasoning
- Test pitches, proposals, or arguments before approaching the real person
- Run scenario simulations: "How would this person respond to X offer?"
- Train sales teams by having them negotiate with synthetic stakeholders
- Understand likely objections and concerns before first contact

This isn't just a chatbot that sounds like someone. It's a persona built on their **inferred mental models, values, and decision frameworks**—grounded in the knowledge graph and validated by the inference engine. The persona incorporates the same analytical facets that were used to understand them. You're essentially creating a strategic simulation of how they think and respond.

### B. Go-to-Market Strategy (Your Domain)

The entire go-to-market strategy is yours to design and execute. This is not a "here's the playbook, go execute it" role. This is "you figure out how to get this in front of people who need it."

Some possibilities:
- Beta launch with VC/PE community (natural early adopters)
- ProductHunt and relevant communities
- Content marketing that showcases the depth
- Integration partnerships that provide distribution
- Sales-led motion for enterprise
- Product-led growth for individuals
- Something completely different that you see

The pricing model needs to be figured out. SaaS subscription? Usage-based? Freemium? Platform + API? That's a strategic decision we make together, but you own the execution.

### C. Competitive Positioning

| Feature | GetSmart | LinkedIn Sales Nav | ZoomInfo | Manual Research |
|---------|----------|-------------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Depth** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Speed** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5 min) | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐ (20+ hrs) |
| **Inference Engine** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (manual only) |
| **Custom Analysis** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (manual only) |
| **Cost** | $ | $$ | $$$ | $$$$ |

**Defensibility:** The inference engine and meta-prompt generator create a technical moat. Competitors would need to rebuild their entire architecture to match this capability.

## IV. The Managing Cofounder Role: Responsibilities & Expectations

This is a **true cofounder partnership**, not a C-level hire. The founding partner handles the tech. You handle **everything else**.

### A. What "Everything Else" Means

**You Own:**
- **Go-to-Market** — Figure out how to get this into the hands of people who need it. What's the messaging? What channels work? How do we acquire users?
- **Sales & Marketing** — Build the demand generation engine. Whether that's content, partnerships, outbound, community, or something novel—you decide and execute.
- **Fundraising** — Tell the story to investors. Build the deck. Model the financials. Manage the process. Close the round.
- **Operations** — Figure out the business model. Set up the company infrastructure. Handle legal, finance, HR. Make the trains run.
- **Team Building** — Recruit the non-tech team (sales, marketing, operations, customer success). Build the culture on your side of the house.
- **Partnerships** — Identify and close strategic partnerships (data providers, integration partners, distribution channels).
- **Customer Success** — Ensure users get value. Build the feedback loops. Manage retention.
- **Strategy** — Work with founding partner on big decisions (pricing, positioning, roadmap priorities, fundraising timing).

**You Don't Own:**
- Product architecture or technical decisions (though you provide input)
- Engineering team management (though you collaborate on hiring)
- Writing code (unless you want to)

### B. What Success Looks Like (Your Metrics)

Success isn't measured by a prescribed roadmap with monthly MRR targets. Success is:

**Early Stage (Months 1-6):**
- We have beta users who are actually using it and getting value
- The value proposition is validated with real human feedback
- We can articulate clearly what this is and who it's for
- There's a clear path to monetization (even if we haven't flipped the switch yet)

**Growth Stage (Months 6-18):**
- People are paying for this (however we decide to monetize it)
- The go-to-market motion is working (we know how to acquire users)
- We're building a brand in the space (people know what GetSmart is)
- We've raised capital to scale (if we decide we need it)

**Scale Stage (Year 2+):**
- This is the intelligence platform people think of first
- We're expanding capabilities faster than competitors can copy the core
- The business model is proven and profitable
- We're building a lasting company, not just a feature

### C. Compensation & Equity

**Equity:** 30-40% cofounder stake (subject to standard 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff)

**Cash Compensation (Post-Seed):** $120-150K base salary (market rate deferred until funding)

**Board Seat:** Automatic upon seed funding close

**Decision Rights:** Joint approval required on major decisions (hires, budget, strategy pivots)

**Vesting Acceleration:** Standard single-trigger on acquisition, double-trigger on change of control

---

## V. Ideal Candidate Profile: Who Thrives in This Role?

### A. Must-Have: Passion for the Problem

This isn't a role for someone who just wants to build a SaaS business. This is for someone who **gets excited about understanding people**. Who thinks:

- "The current tools for researching people are terrible and shallow"
- "There's something powerful in drawing inferences beyond stated facts"
- "Multi-agent AI systems + knowledge graphs = genuinely new capability"
- "Intelligence about stakeholders is undervalued and underpriced"

You need to **believe in this vision** and want to spend years making it real.

### B. Must-Have: 0-to-1 Experience

You've taken something from nothing to something real before. You know what early-stage chaos feels like. You can navigate ambiguity. You can figure things out.

This could be:
- Founded a company (succeeded or failed, learned either way)
- Been employee #1-10 at a startup that grew
- Led a new product line from conception to market
- Built and scaled a GTM motion from scratch
- Raised capital (or been deeply involved in the process)

### C. Ideal-Have: Domain Expertise

These aren't required, but they'd be powerful:

- **VC/PE background** — You've done due diligence, you know what investors need
- **Sales/BD experience** — You've sold complex tools to professionals before
- **Research/intelligence background** — You've done stakeholder research manually and know its value
- **AI/ML familiarity** — You understand what LLMs can and can't do
- **Enterprise SaaS GTM** — You've sold to businesses with multiple stakeholders

### D. Success Indicators

**You're a Fit If:**
- You think about people strategically (network effects, influence, motivation)
- You get energized by ambiguous, greenfield building
- You prefer equity upside over salary security
- You have strong opinions but change your mind with new data
- You can sell an idea before the product is built
- You're comfortable being the "non-technical" cofounder (but technically literate)

**You're NOT a Fit If:**
- You need a proven playbook to execute
- You want clear metrics and structured processes from day one
- You think "sales and marketing" is beneath you
- You can't work collaboratively with a strong technical cofounder
- You want to delegate and manage, not roll up your sleeves

### C. Working Style & Culture

**What to Expect:**
- **Intensity:** Startup hours (50-60/week), especially pre-MVP
- **Ownership:** You're not executing someone else's vision; you're shaping it
- **Collaboration:** Weekly strategy sessions with founding partner, daily async coordination
- **Autonomy:** Own your domain (operations, GTM, team) with minimal oversight
- **Feedback Culture:** Direct, honest, frequent. No corporate politics.

**Remote-Friendly:** Core team can be distributed, but expect quarterly in-person strategy sessions.

## Appendix A: Technical Architecture Details

### Multi-Agent System (17+ Specialized Agents)

**Research Phase:**
- WebResearchAgent: Brave Search API + intelligent scraping
- NewsResearchAgent: News API for media mentions
- CrunchbaseAgent: Funding, investors, M&A data
- LinkedInAgent: Employment, education, connections
- SocialGraphAgent: Maps relationships from public sources

**Analysis Phase:**
- TimelineAgent: Chronological career trajectory analysis
- PhilosophyExtractorAgent: Identifies core beliefs and operational ideology
- CommunicationStyleAgent: Analyzes how subject communicates (public talks, writing)
- DecisionFrameworkAgent: Identifies patterns in decision-making
- NetworkStrengthAgent: Assesses influence level and relationship quality

**Inference Phase (Key Differentiator):**
- InferenceAgent: Draws conclusions beyond stated facts
- PatternRecognitionAgent: Identifies recurring themes across career
- MotivationAnalysisAgent: Hypothesizes core drivers
- PredictiveAgent: Generates future behavior predictions with confidence scores
- ValidationAgent: Cross-checks inferences against multiple data points

**Synthesis Phase:**
- ExecutiveSummaryAgent: Generate predictive model of how they operate
- SectionCompilerAgents: Generate each report section
- FacetAnalysisAgents: Apply relevant analytical lenses
- CitationManagerAgent: Ensure all claims are sourced
- ReportAssemblerAgent: Combine sections, generate bibliography

### Knowledge Graph Schema

**Entities:** People, organizations, concepts, events
**Relationships:** Founded, invested_in, collaborated_with, influenced_by, employed_at
**Facts:** Timestamped statements with confidence scores and sources
**Inferences:** Conclusions drawn by agents with reasoning chains

**Example Inference:**
```json
{
  "type": "motivation",
  "content": "Subject prioritizes producer sovereignty over profit maximization",
  "reasoning": "Rejected three acquisition offers (2019, 2021, 2023) despite favorable terms. Public statements emphasize farmer empowerment over growth metrics. Board composition favors industry practitioners over investors.",
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "based_on": ["fact_123", "fact_456", "relationship_789"],
  "created_by": "InferenceAgent_v1",
  "validated_by": ["ValidationAgent", "PhilosophyExtractorAgent"]
}
```

### Analysis Facet System

The system has a library of analytical lenses that can be applied to understand different aspects of a person. Think of them as "ways of looking" rather than rigid frameworks.

**Example Facets (Extensible):**
- How they build and maintain relationships
- How they communicate and persuade different audiences
- How they approach risk and iteration
- How they identify non-obvious opportunities
- How they break down complex problems
- Their leadership style and team dynamics
- Their negotiation patterns and value priorities

The key is that facets are **selected based on who the person is**, not applied uniformly. An early-stage founder gets analyzed through an innovation and risk lens. A senior executive through organizational dynamics and stakeholder management. An investor through pattern recognition and thesis development.

**Adding New Facets:**
The system is designed to be extended with new analytical lenses. You could add:
- "Board governance approach" (for investors evaluating directors)
- "Technical depth assessment" (for recruiters hiring engineers)
- "Media savviness" (for PR teams)
- "Crisis response patterns" (for risk assessment)
- Whatever dimension of analysis matters for your use case

---

## Appendix B: Why This Matters

Most research tools give you **data aggregation**. LinkedIn Sales Navigator shows you their job history. ZoomInfo gives you contact info. Google gives you everything they've ever said publicly.

None of them give you **intelligence**.

GetSmart is built on a simple insight: **AI agents can draw conclusions that humans would draw after 20 hours of research, but in 5 minutes.**

When you research someone manually, you're not just collecting facts. You're:
- Identifying patterns in their decision-making
- Understanding their core motivations
- Predicting how they'll respond to certain approaches
- Mapping their true influence network (not just their LinkedIn connections)
- Seeing contradictions between public statements and actual behavior

That's what the inference engine does. That's what the multi-agent architecture enables. That's what makes this different.

And that's why this isn't just a nice-to-have tool. It's a **new capability**.

The market for intelligence about people is massive and currently underserved:
- VCs spending weeks on founder due diligence
- Sales teams doing surface-level account research
- Recruiters making $100K placements based on resumes
- Consultants billing $500/hour for stakeholder analysis
- Journalists spending days profiling subjects

All of them need what GetSmart can provide. They just don't know it exists yet.

**That's your job: make them know it exists.**
